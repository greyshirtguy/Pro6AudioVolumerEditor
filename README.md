# Pro6AudioVolumerEditor

![Screenshot](ScreenShot.png)

ProPresenter 6 allows you to add Audio cues to slides - but there is nowhere to set the volume of each cue.
This application lets you open a Pro6 document that has Audio (and Video) cues attached to slides and edit the volumes
of each audio (or video) cue on each slide while listening.  

Custom volumes for media cues only works on Pro6 running on a Mac. The windows version of Pro6 seems to ignore the volume attribute and plays audio at full-volume.

To get a copy of the pre-compiled Application, download "Pro6AudioVolumeEditor.app.zip" from here:

**How to use this application:**
* Close ProPresenter6.
* Make a backup Your library :)
* Back it up again :)
* Open this app - Your library should be listed on the left side 
(Only works with default library in version 1 - Selecting library is on the TODO list)
* Scroll through the library and select your document - it should appear in the slide viewer.
* Any slide that has audio (or video) will have an symbol in the top left to indicate so.
* Those slides will also have a volume slider showing the current volume of that media item for that slide.
* Click a slide to preview the audio.  Slide the volume slider to adjust.
* Once you are happy with changes (I guess all slides have a similar volume) - then click save button.
* Version 1.1 now works with Audio Playlists too!!!

**Important Disclaimer:**

This is not supported by Renewed Vision (the makers of ProPresenter 6).  
Use at your own risk. Make a backup copy of your library folder first!
It should be pretty safe to use.
The logic is pretty simple and should not result in any corruption.
It reads in the Pro6 file as a sinlge XML document object, update the volume attributes of AudioElements with new volumes
and re-saves the XML back to the document.
For more info, read the source! :)
